# My Portfolio 😁

This is my first personal site, and I know that it's very simple but I almost went nuts making it because I had to refactor my CSS three times so that the site would actually be responsive. It turned out that I had just messed up the way I structured my code from the very beginning and I wasn't exactly following best practices so I just started from scratch and did it the right way and then it was actually quite simple. I think I may have learned the most about web development from this project if I'm being honest.

## Languages I Used 👨‍💻

From looking at my page you can tell that this is a static website, and, as such, you probably derived that I used *HTML* and *CSS* (as I've already mentioned), and two lines of *JS* (actually you probably didn't derive the latter). I use VS Code and I finally discovered the power of **Emmet**, which made coding my HTML at least an order of magnitude easier. I feel pretty comfortable with HTML and CSS and I'm relatively well-versed in JS but I'm still learning how to use it to interact with and "alter" the DOM.

## The Future of my Portfolio 📈

I am proud of this site because I did stretch myself and did not just do the bare minimum. However, I wanted to create this as a foundation on which I could build upon and progressively make better as I grow as a developer. I haven't actually implemented any *web3* elements just yet but I'll be adding them in soon. This site will look completely different in one year, showcasing the skills I will learn in the coming months. This is just the beginning!
