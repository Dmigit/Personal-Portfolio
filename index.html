                 <p>Welcome to my website! I am a rising high school senior that's excited about the future of technology and, more specifically, how startups will leverage this technology to make the world a better place and advance our civilization. A little after the 2021 NFT boom I realized that a lot of innovation had been happening in web3 for some time, so I decided to go all in and teach myself everything about web development. This is how I found out that I had a passion for coding and I've been hacking away ever since. I'm currently trying to get better at React (JavaScript library) and Solidity (smart contract language). Below you will find a few of the projects I've done. I plan on adding web3 projects as I complete them, these are just the projects I worked on as I learned the basics of web development! p.s.You can click on the title of each project to visit it's github repo!</p>

              <img src="css/screenshot1.png" alt="">
              <p>This is a project I did to work on my responsive design skills using flexbox. It represents the landing page of TSMC (the Taiwan Semiconductor Company),<wbr> which happens to be one of my favorite companies. I used html and css to build and style it respectively and used flexbox to make sure that the <wbr> content would maintain it's intergity at any screen size!</p>

              <img src="css/mixedmessages.png" id="mixed-messages" alt="">
              <p>I practiced writing javascript with this message generator that outputs a random inspirational message every time a user runs it. It was a fun JS-only project but I plan to integrate JS into my future web applications. (p.s. I used JS on this website, click on my name at the top of the page:)</p>

              <button class="title"><a href="https://github.com/Dmigit/WavePortal-dApp" target="_blank"><h3>WavePortal dApp</h3></a></button>
              <img src="css/screenshot2.png" alt="">
              <p>This is the project that I am most proud of and that has taken me the most time. It is a full-stack dApp (decentralized Application) that allows users<wbr> to connect their wallet and send a "wave" to an ethereum adress. I wrote a smart contract in Solidity and deployed it to the Rinkeby test network.<wbr> Then I used React as a frontend to interact with the smart contract. This is just the beginning of this project. I'm sharpening up my React skills so that<wbr> I can build a beatiful frontend with a lot of functionality.</p>
